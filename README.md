<summary>About Me</summary>
<br>

Hi, I'm Oliver, and I love being involved with data! With nearly 5 years experience working in datasets of varying degrees, from easy-to-digest Excel spreadsheets to larger datasets used in SQL, R and Python.

With growth for the data field set to grow about 28% through 2026 [Schroeder, 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernhardschroeder/2021/06/11/the-data-analytics-profession-and-employment-is-exploding-three-trends-that-matter/?sh=356375f73f81)

Also, as a bonus fact, during my time at MyTutor, I won the data compeition for building a SQL database from the ground up.
