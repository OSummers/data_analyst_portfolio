<summary>About Me</summary>
<br>

**Who are you?** - Hi, I'm Oliver, and I love being involved with data! With nearly 5 years experience working in datasets of varying degrees, from easy-to-digest Excel spreadsheets to larger datasets of up to 500+ TB of data used in SQL, and R/Python.

**Why do you do what you do?** - I've always been invested in data and using applications to get results, starting with music programming and technology and later utilising SQL, Excel and Tableau/Power BI to drive business decisions. According to [Schroeder, 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernhardschroeder/2021/06/11/the-data-analytics-profession-and-employment-is-exploding-three-trends-that-matter/?sh=356375f73f81) With growth for the data field set to grow about 28% through 2026. I'm confident that the future of data has never been more exciting!

**What expertise and skills do you bring?** - While I bring with me the invaluable skillsets in using SQL, Excel, Tableau/Power BI, I'm a qualified educator for 6+ years, with a pedagogical approach in presenting complex information, having supported the education sector in the UK and US to students aged 5- 25. This is ciritical when dealing with both business and technical stakeholders who rely on data to plan ahead with strategic business decisions that can have a major impact.

**What are you looking for?** - Looking for a role that prioritises data in their workplace that I'm really keen in analysing and finding results for. I'd love to hear from you to discuss further about what you're looking for in a data analyst role and the needs of the business, so please do get in touch so we can discuss further. Looking forward to speaking with you!

*P.S. quick bonus fact for you - at MyTutor, I won the data compeition in the data team for building a database in SQL from the ground up, focusing on different coloured shirts and presenting this to the team. As an award, I won an emoji of me with a crown and a box of chocolates!*
