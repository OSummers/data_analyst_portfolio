## **Summary**

BTS isn't the only group from Korea who's taking the world by storm, k-pop is a growing phenomenom in the past decade, so this analysis investigates some of the trends in how k-pop idols are selected, with the purpose to understand how entertainment companies how been selecting idols from the audition processes.

## **Key Findings**

<details>
<summary>1.</summary> Firstly, let's look at all countries of where k-pop idols are from.

It may be no surprise that South Korea is the biggest country and is the outlier found here however, some of the biggest idols are from neighboring countries like Japan and China. The biggest country outside of the Asia was the USA, which is a big market for k-pop outside of Asia. Somewhat suprisingly, no countries from Europe were found.

<summary>2.</summary> Next, we look at countries and genders to see the differences between them. Here we have South Korea separated from the rest of the countries where k-pop idols are from.

In South Korea, male performers were 12% higher than females. The same pattern is seen in China and USA too however, those from Japan and Taiwan, females represented the overall majority for these countries.

<summary>3.</summary> Let's see how many are in groups compared to those not in groups (i.e. solo acts), and if those who are solo or groups are also in other groups. Sometimes these are not as super groups, comprising from other groups (e.g. SuperM).

The outlier here is that many idols are not in other groups, meaning the overall majority are dedicated to those particuar groups. This would suggest that while it is not uncommon that k-pop idols will have solo careers separate from the groups, it is not common for them to form other groups, highly likely this would be a decision from the companies, rather than the k-pop stars themselves.

<details>
<summary>4.</summary> Let's now look at genders across all countries and which year groups are most popular with k-pop stars.

Data shows here that most popular age groups are between 1994 - 2000 (aged 22 - 27) the increase could suggest that with the rise in popularity, more k-pop idols are making their debut to meet the global demand. The decline from 2000 could potentially be due to k-pop idols who have not yet made their debut and are still undergoing the training process. 

While some countries (Japan, Taiwan) showed that that there were more females than males, the data here reinfornces the fact that there are more male idols than female by 6.41%.

<details>
<summary>5.</summary> Finally, let's specifically look at South Korea, (being the most popular country, unsurpisingly) and what the median age is for each city.

Seoul, with it being the capital is the most popular city where k-pop idols are from. However, the data here shows that the top cities in South Korea appear to have a larger amount of females (89 in total) compared to males (99 in total). Median age across cities in South Korea range from aged 19 to 33, with the oldest for female being 33 and male being 40. This would imply that the lifespan for males is higher than females.

Some of these k-pop stars who are based in South Korea were also born in North America
