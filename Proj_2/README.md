## **Summary**

With the rise of subscription services rising across all forms of media entertainment, video games has been a growing industry in the past decade, and has only accelerated since the pandemic. With this in mind, there's a wealth of genres and payment methods being offered to consumers, from free to play (F2P) that off in-game purchases, to standard one-time purchases. The purpose of this project is to understand current consumer trends, and how this may affect future development of games, from AAA to indie, and how consumers approach gaming.

## **Key Findings**

Firstly, let's look at Free-to-play (F2P) games and they differ between score and votes

The data shows that FPS game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the clear outlier here, with 6M+ votes, while two FPS games are also featured in the top 10 by score too. This suggests that FPS games are among the most popular with gamers. However, with the amount of votes doesn't necessarily equate to best rated, as "psychological horror" and "story-rich" genres appear to have the higher rating compared to the likes of "Battle Royale" and "MOBA" that have higher votes but lower score overall.

Let's now see how F2P games compared with paid games.

If we look at how many players are playing free vs paid games, we see an interesting response where most players reported here are in fact playing paid games, as opposed to free ones, despite the finanaical incentive offered by F2P games. Paid games far outweigh the F2P games with a 81.20% total compared to F2P at 18.80%

Now we know that most top rated games are in fact paid, let's take a look at the most common price points that gamers are paying for their games. This does not reflected discount prices from publishers/developers.

Data shows that the most common price point at the higher end was $19.99 with 40+ games listed, while the lowest all sat at one game only, with the lowest paid being $0.99. This could indicate that higher priced games are perceived to be rated better by either score or votes, and that the lower the monetary value, the lower the gaming value received by gamers.

With the rise in subrscription services with the likes of Xbox's Game Pass and PlayStation's PS Plus, it's important to note what type of games consumers are playing. Below explores this question further, looking at highest/lowest performing in terms of genres.

Open world genre appears to be the most favoured amongst the top 250 rated, followed closely by FPS. This would also be in line with the most rated games by votes. Where the lowest performing genres in the top rated only had one game of each genre in the list. While "Action-Adventure" is listed as one of the lowest performing genres, this could be made up in other genres listed, such as "Action" genre, for example. The results presented by the data here would point that open world and FPS games could be the continuation of games released, mainly by AAA publishers, compared to 2D games that are primarily released by indie publishers.

What years were most popular with most rated games?

As we can see, 2016 - 2018 were strong years for game releases, yet suprising to note that there was a decline in newer games being featured, despite the COVID-19 pandemic providing a boom in gaming, gamers were still rating games within earlier time periods, and would suggest that these games have still retained their product value over the years.

## **Conclusion**

To outline some of the key elements from this analysis:

- Paid games were substantially more played than F2P by 81.20%
- The biggest price for paid games was $19.99, Lowest priced games were between $0.99 and $1.99.
- The most popular genre found was open world, shortly followed up by FPS
